# ArrayUtils App

This project started as a way of teasing my workmates.

And also a *vendetta*.

One of my workmates left his computer unlocked, opportunity I used to change his desktop's background to an image of "Dora the Explorer".

Since that moment, we all block our computers before leaving them unattended, but whenever any of us forgets, we change his/her background. Having been me the first to change a background, now everybody blames me the first if they arrive at their computer and find their background changed.

When I forget to lock my computer I am also the victim of these attacks. One day, I opened my laptop and saw an big brown spider as my background (damn it!). These animals are the ones I **hate the most**. Furthermore, they started to send me images of spiders through instant messaging. That day, I reached my limit. I needed to think of a way to **stop all their annoying jokes**.

I didn't want to change the main theme of the joke, this is, changing the background, but now everybody locks their computer when they leave it unattended. **I had to find a alternative**.

So, let's see.. It would be awesome if I could change my colleagues backgrounds **remotely**. At my company, one of the products we develop is mobile apps. With Ionic, Angular and NodeJs. A-ha! NodeJs is known for its **poor security**. When you install a package from NPM, you don't know if what you are installing is safe or not, unless you examine its source code. Knowing this, I decided to create a NPM package and persuade my teammates to install it in their computers in a way I could execute, then, arbitrary commands. Those commands could range from changing the background, opening random windows, rebooting their computers unexpectedly to gathering information from their computers like user information, network information, SSH keys, etc.

So, let's go!
